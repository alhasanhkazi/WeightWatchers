Things need to know before evaluation

1. This is a maven project using required maven dependancies.
2. All the programs are located in the src/test/java folder. Package and class names indicate corresponding sections and exercises.
3. Java SDK, Android SDK, and Appium server needed to be installed in the machine where the programs will run.
4. All paths are relative to the project structure and all required binary files are included in the project. 
5. The web application testing programs will run in a chrome browser. So Chrome needed to be installed n the machine where the programs will run.
6. File paths are set for a Mac operating system. Necessary code changes(paths) are needed if it is needed to run in a windows machine.
7. For the mobile application testing I used my own device ID. Appropriate device ID needs to be set in the desired capabilities.
8. The project is implemented targeting the assessment only. Page object model is not properly implemented.
